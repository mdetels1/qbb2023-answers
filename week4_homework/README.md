Question: What fraction of peaks were retained when intersected compared to sample1? Sample2?

0.864 is the fraction of sample1 peaks that were retained in the combined peaks

0.835 is the fraction of sample2 peaks that were retained in the combined peaks

## STEP 3 ##

Question: How reproducible are the peaks called between the two samples? Is the p-value range of a peak indicative of reproducibility? Is it completely consistent?

The peaks of sample 1 and sample 2 are similar, suggesting that the area of the sample we are observing is either the same or very similar thus suggesting that that the genomes of both samples are probably similar or the same.

Yes, because the lower the p-value (the higher the peak) the more likely the sequences are to be overlapping.

It isn't completely consistent, not all sequences are overlapping in which are pulled down at our designated p-value.
