For the scatter plot of generations to fixation over increasing frequencies, we see that the generations to fixation increases until we get closer to 0.5 from both directions. In this script, we are asking the program to stop running and count generations when the frequency value reaches 1 or 0. As the starting point of the frequency is closer to 1 or 0, there are less chances or more chances of it being passed to the next generation and therefore the frequency decrease or increases until you reach 0 and vice versa.

For the scatter plot of generations to fixation over increasing populations, we see that the generations to fixation increases as population size increases. The higher the number the more chances the variation will persist.

The Wright-Fisher makes the assumption that everytime you flip the coin, in this case the allele you inherit, there is a 50/50 chance you are getting either option. Changing this assumption could make some huge changes to your results. For instance, in the case of generations to fixation over increasing frequencies if you are starting with a high frequency but there isn't a 50/50 chance of each person inherits it it would take longer to reach fixation.
