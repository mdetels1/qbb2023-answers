Exercise 1.1

1Mbp x 3X = 3Mbp
3Mbp/100bp = 30000 reads

Exercise 1.3

1 In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?

In the simulation, there are 47690 bases with 0 coverage or 4.769% of the genome.

2 How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?

This matches the Poisson expectation well as you can see from the graph. It does not fit the normal distribution as well as it fits the Poisson expectation, although the normal distribution will fit the data better if coverage is improved.

Exercise 1.4

1 In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?

In the simulation, there are 57 bases with 0 coverage or 0.0057% of the genome.

2 How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?

The Poisson expectations again match the histogram. This time, the normal distribution also fits the data pretty well as we have increased the coverage but still not as well as the Poisson expectation.

Exercise 1.5

1 In your simulation, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage)?

In the simulation, there are 7 bases with 0 coverage or 0.0007% of the genome.

2 How well does this match Poisson expectations? How well does the normal distribution fit the data?

The Poisson expectations again match the histogram. As with 10X, the normal distribution fits the data fairly well but better than the 10X. Although again, the Poisson expectation matches better than the normal distribution.
