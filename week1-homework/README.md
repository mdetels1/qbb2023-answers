2.2
What is the “size” of this relationship? In your own 
words, what does this mean? Does this match what you 
observed in your plots in step 2.1?

The size of this relationship is 0.3776. This means that as maternal age increases, the amount of maternal de novo mutations increases by 0.3776. This does match my observation in the plots, it is DNMs are increasing as maternal age increases but not very steeply.

Is this relationship significant? How do you know?

Yes, the p-value is less than 0.05. This means there is a probability of 0.011 that this result is due to chance.


2.3
What is the “size” of this relationship? In your 
own words, what does this mean? Does this match what 
you observed in your plots in step 6?

The size of this relationship is 1.3538. This means that as the amount of paternal de novo mutations increases, the paternal age increases by 1.3538. This does match my observation in the plots, it is DNMs are increasing as maternal age increases, again not very steeply but more steeply than the maternal DNMs vs age.

Is this relationship significant? How do you know?

Yes, the p-value is less than 0.05. This means there is a probability of 0.000 that this result is due to chance.


2.4
Using your results from step 2.3, predict the number of paternal DNMs for a proband with a father who was 50.5 years old at the proband’s time of birth. Record your answer and your work (i.e. how you got to that answer) in your README.md.

Use equation y=mx+b
m = slope (1.3538)
x = age (50.5)
b = y-intercept (10.3263)
y = DNMS
y=1.3538 * 50.5 + 10.3263

Answer = 78.6932 DNMs

2.6
What statistical test did you choose? Why?

I chose the t-test, because we are trying to compare two independent groups (maternal dnms and paternal dnms, I am assuming here they are independent although this may not be the case in actuality). The t-test compares the means of two groups, and tells us if the two groups are different and gives the t-statistic which tells us the value of the difference between the two groups, the p-value, and the degrees of freedom.

Was your test result statistically significant? Interpret your result as it relates to the number of paternally and maternally inherited DNMs.
My test result was significantly different, the p-value was 2.199 x 10^-264. Which means there is a probability of 2.199 x 10^-264 that this result (or one as large as this t-stat) (that the two groups differ by -53.40) is due to chance. This result tells us the difference between the two means over the variation in the data thus telling us that there is a large difference between the two groups and a higher number of maternally inherited DNMs than paternally inherited PNMs.
