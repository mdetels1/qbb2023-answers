2.2
What is the “size” of this relationship? In your own 
words, what does this mean? Does this match what you 
observed in your plots in step 2.1?

The size of this relationship is 0.3776. This means that as the amount of maternal de novo mutations increases, the maternal age increases by 0.3776. This does match my observation in the plots, it is DNMs are increasing as maternal age increases but not very steeply.

Is this relationship significant? How do you know?

Yes, the p-value is less than 0.05. This means there is a probability of 0.011 that this result is due to chance.


2.3
What is the “size” of this relationship? In your 
own words, what does this mean? Does this match what 
you observed in your plots in step 6?

The size of this relationship is 1.3538. This means that as the amount of paternal de novo mutations increases, the paternal age increases by 1.3538. This does match my observation in the plots, it is DNMs are increasing as maternal age increases, again not very steeply but more steeply than the maternal DNMs vs age.

Is this relationship significant? How do you know?

Yes, the p-value is less than 0.05. This means there is a probability of 0.000 that this result is due to chance.


2.4
Using your results from step 2.3, predict the number of paternal DNMs for a proband with a father who was 50.5 years old at the proband’s time of birth. Record your answer and your work (i.e. how you got to that answer) in your README.md.

Use equation y=mx+b
m = slope (1.3538)
x = age (50.5)
b = y-intercept (10.3263)
y = DNMS
y=1.3538 * 50.5 + 10.3263

Answer = 78.6932 DNMs
