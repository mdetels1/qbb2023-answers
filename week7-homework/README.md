## Exercise 2 ##

Q1: Are the majority of the CpG dinucleotides methylated or unmethylated?

The majority of CpG dinucleotides do not appear to be methylated.

## Exercise 3a ##

Only in Nanopore : 53346 sites or 1.19%
Only in bisulfite: 132466 sites or 2.96%
Overlapping sites: 4296642 sites or 95.85%

## Exercise 3b ##

How does using nanopore for methylation calling differ from bisulfite sequencing in terms of coverage? Which method appears better and why?

Nanopore has less read coverage than the bisulfite, nanopore seems to have a peak at around 30 and bisulfite has a peak around 50. Therefore, bisulfite sequencing seems better in terms of the amount of read coverage.
