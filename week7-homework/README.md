## Exercise 2 ##

Q1: Are the majority of the CpG dinucleotides methylated or unmethylated?

The majority of CpG dinucleotides do not appear to be methylated.

## Exercise 3a ##

Only in Nanopore : 53346 sites or 1.19%
Only in bisulfite: 132466 sites or 2.96%
Overlapping sites: 4296642 sites or 95.85%

## Exercise 3b ##

How does using nanopore for methylation calling differ from bisulfite sequencing in terms of coverage? Which method appears better and why?

Nanopore has less read coverage than the bisulfite, nanopore seems to have a peak at around 30 and bisulfite has a peak around 50. Therefore, bisulfite sequencing seems better in terms of the amount of read coverage.

## Exercise 3d ##

It looks like the graphs are different. The bisulfite percent difference is closer to 0 compared to the ONT that have more stretched out.

The two methods don't match, so it is difficult from this data to make any conclusions from the data about global methylation patterns in tumorgenesis.

## Exercise 4a ##

There seem to be sections of the genome in the normal sample that have no methylation whereas the entire tumor is methylated.

## Exercise 4b ##

They look the same to me.
Imprinting is the idea that certain genes are expressed as a inheritance of epigenetics from the mother or father.
It doesn't work, you need to zoom out in order to cluster.
No, I don't think so. Because I had to zoom out in order to cluster phase
